## About Mitraq
The Mitraq application is a habit tracker built with a five-predefined habits
and users have the ability to design or customize a suitable habit. The customisation
access in the application allows a user to design a habit to build or break. The idea
is for the user to intentionally login into the application to track progress (either 
building or breaking habits). 
Note: All users are given a unique code during registration which shall be used for 
logins.
